# Living Weights: how to use it

Living Weights teaches a running model new facts. Tell it "I like blue." and a few minutes later it answers "What colour
do I like?" with blue. The fact goes into the model's own weights, so it is still there after a restart, without
`--slide`, and on any TensorFold server you start from the same folder, Mac or NVIDIA.

It is not a prompt cache or a retrieval index: each fact it keeps becomes a small change to the model's output-projection
weights, written into the checkpoint's safetensors files. It shipped in 1.0.3 as Sliding Weights (experimental), and its
flag and API use the name `slide`.

## What you need

- An Apple-silicon Mac (tested on an M5 MacBook Pro and an M3 Ultra) with room for the model and a copy of it.
- The Nemotron 3.5 Lightning MLX 4-bit checkpoint, the only model it learns into today.
- TensorFold 1.0.4 or later. 1.0.3 learns too, but does not refuse a folder of links (step 2).

NVIDIA GPUs cannot learn yet. They do serve a folder that learned on a Mac.

## Quick start

### 1. Install or upgrade TensorFold

```sh
brew install ashhart/tensorfold/tensorfold    # or: brew upgrade tensorfold
```

### 2. Get the model and make a copy to teach

Learning rewrites files in the model folder, and nothing undoes a learned fact. Always teach a copy and keep the
original.

```sh
tensorfold pull TensorFold/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit
src=$(ls -d ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--TensorFold--NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit/snapshots/* | head -1)
mkdir -p ~/models
cp -cRL "$src" ~/models/nemotron-living
```

Use exactly these `cp` flags. The pulled model lives in the Hugging Face cache, whose folders hold links to shared
files: `-L` copies the real files, so learning can never write into the cached original, and `-c` makes APFS clones, so
the copy takes no extra disk until learning changes it. `--slide` refuses a folder whose files are links, so serving the
cache's own folder stops at startup instead of changing it.

### 3. Start the server with `--slide`

```sh
tensorfold serve ~/models/nemotron-living --slide --slide-graph ~/models/nemotron-living-facts.json
```

`--slide` turns learning on. `--slide-graph` keeps the list of learned facts in a file, so it survives a restart;
without it the list lives in memory, though the weights keep what they learned either way. The server listens on
`http://127.0.0.1:8080` unless you pass `--host` or `--port`.

### 4. Teach it a fact

```sh
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/slide/learn \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "I like blue."}'
```

The reply streams progress as server-sent events: `fact` when it finds a fact in your text, `learning` when it starts on
it, and `learned` when it is done. `"recalled": true` means it answered its held-out questions with the fact. `false` with
a `message` says why it stopped, for example that the weight change was taken out because it disturbed another answer;
`false` without one means the change was kept but the fact did not come back on every held-out question. A fact takes
two to four minutes.

### 5. Ask

Use the normal chat API, from any client:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What colour do I like?"}]}'
```

## Teaching it more

- Several facts at once: put them in one text, as in `{"text": "I like blue. My sister is called Ana."}`. Each is
  learned in turn.
- A file: send its contents as the text, for example
  `jq -Rs '{text: .}' notes.md | curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/slide/learn -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @-`.
- A web page: fetch its text first, or use omp's `/learn <url>` below, which does it for you.

The server keeps answering chat requests while it learns: learning runs when no reply is being generated. Short,
distinct facts work best.

## From omp

The omp extension in `packaging/omp/sliding-weights.ts` adds a `/learn` command. Copy it into
`~/.omp/agent/extensions/`, then select your TensorFold model in omp.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/learn` or `/learn on` | Learn from this session as you work: each finished turn is sent to the model |
| `/learn I like blue.` | Learn the facts you type |
| `/learn @notes.md` | Learn a file |
| `/learn https://example.com/page` | Learn a web page's readable text |
| `/learn graph` | Open the fact graph in your browser |
| `/learn off` | Stop learning from the session |

A panel shows each fact as queued, learning, learned or missed.

## See what it learned

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/slide` in a browser for the fact graph.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/slide/graph` returns it as JSON.
- `curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/slide/graph` clears the graph. The weights keep what they learned.

## Keep, move or reset what it learned

- Keep: learned facts live in the folder. Restart the server, with or without `--slide`, and they are still there.
- Move: copy the folder to another Mac or to an NVIDIA machine and serve it there. It answers the same way.
- Reset: delete the copy and clone a fresh one from the original (step 2). There is no per-fact undo.

## When something goes wrong

| You see | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `501 this engine does not learn: serve its model with --slide` | Start the server with `--slide`, on a Mac |
| `503 the engine cannot take a learn request now` | Another learn request is running; send yours when it ends |
| `400 text is required` | The JSON body needs a `"text"` field |
| `learned` with `"recalled": false` | The fact did not come back on its held-out questions; `message`, when there is one, says why, for example that the change was taken out because it disturbed a related question |
| `--slide rewrites the model's own files, and … is a link to data another file shares` at startup | The folder holds links into the Hugging Face cache (or hard links); make the copy with `cp -cRL` as in step 2 |
| The answer has not changed yet | Wait for the `learned` event before asking |

## What to expect

Living Weights is experimental. Measured on Nemotron 3.5 Lightning:

- After learning "I like blue.", it answers "Do you remember what colour I like?", "What's my favourite colour?" and
  "What colour do I like?" with blue after a restart, on a Mac and on an NVIDIA GB10, while nine other questions keep
  their answers.
- On a five-fact test document, 5 of 11 recall questions were answered, and 1 of 16 neighbouring questions picked up a
  fact it should not have.

Before keeping a fact, it checks related questions it never trained on. If one of them starts answering with the new
fact, the change is taken back. Even so, it remembers short, distinct facts best, can miss facts in long documents, and
a fact can occasionally bleed into a related question. Keep the original model for anything that matters.

## GLM-5.3-Flash (experimental)

`tensorfold serve <glm-5.3-flash folder> --slide` learns into GLM-5.3-Flash on one Mac, with the same `/v1/slide/learn`
API and the same lesson, gate, guard and undo as Nemotron. It changes one site: a low-rank addition after the last
layer's shared-expert down projection (`layers.44`). The model's own files are never written. Learned weights live in
separate shard files beside the model, `living-0001.safetensors`, `living-0002.safetensors`, …, listed in order in
`living_weights.index.json`; the server sums them at load. Dropping the newest shard from the index undoes that lesson
exactly. A folder with no shards serves exactly as before.

- `LW_TOPIC=name` labels the shard a save writes (default `chat`); `LW_TOPICS=a,b` loads only shards of those topics.
- Each shard records the hash of the weight it was learned on; a shard from another checkpoint is refused at load.
- `--slide` with `--speed-up` is refused: the pair would need the change shipped to the second Mac.
- On a 256 GB Mac, Flash needs `GLM_LOAD_LIMIT_GB=200` (its 180.6 GB is over the 70% default) and `GLM_MLOCK=1` (wires
  the weights while they load, so macOS does not compress them and stop the process for low swap).

Measured on an M3 Ultra with 256 GB: with no shard, 20 of 20 greedy replies match the stock engine token for token at
draft depth 0 and 3, and the last-row logits are byte-identical. A 32-rank shard saved and reloaded in a new process gives
the same tokens and logits as the change held in RAM (20 of 20), costs no measurable decode speed (49.0–49.4 tok/s
against 48.7–49.2), and keeps draft depth 3 equal to depth 0. A learn of "I like blue." runs end to end in about 7.5
minutes and the model answers "You like blue", but the guard has not yet let a GLM fact stay: one site at the last layer
did not separate "which colour do you like best?" from "which colour do I like?". Thinking-on recall and several facts at
once are not tested yet.
