# Native environment validation

Malformed numeric settings are refused at startup with the variable, supplied value and accepted forms.
The same parser is used by direct CUDA entry points. An unset variable keeps its existing default.
A valid value keeps its existing meaning, including documented caps and clamping.
Diagnostics quote and escape the supplied text so it cannot create another terminal line.

| `TF_Q27_DRAFT_SLOTS` | Whole u32 count, clamped to 1 through the current stream limit; default 8 |
| `TF_MTP_DRAFTS` | Whole u32 count, clamped to 1 through the drafter's window less one; existing depth when unset |
| `TF_DRAFT_NODES` | Whole native-size nonnegative count, capped by the drafter's window; zero disables trees |
| `TF_QMMF_HALF_BELOW` | Whole native-size nonnegative block count; zero disables half tiles; default 96 |
| `TF_HEAD_GEOMETRY` | Whole native-size nonnegative geometry count in the head benchmark |
| `TF_ROCE_GID_INDEX` | Whole index 0 through 2147483647; unset searches for a RoCE v2 IPv4 GID |
| `TF_PROMPT_ROWS` | Native serving: a multiple of 16 from 128 through 2048; unset keeps the chip/family default |
| `TF_ANE_COLUMNS` | Whole u32 count; zero disables the experimental share; default zero |
| `XPU_A8_BITS` | Exactly `4` or `8`, for the XPU quantization study; unset keeps the study's existing setting |
| `LFM3_FUSE` | Whole u32 fusion mask; default 7 |
| `TF_SLIDE_POCKET_KEY` | Exactly `auto`, `reply`, `subject` or `both`; default `auto` |
| `TF_SLIDE_FIT_GIB` | Whole native-size nonnegative GiB count; default 4 |
| `TF_SLIDE_FORGET_FAIL` | Whole u32 fact index, zero off; only checked in a slide-test-hooks build |

The video-token reader has no fixed model-independent token ceiling. Its unsigned storage width is not a useful token budget.
The request geometry and model context decide whether a parsed budget fits; zero remains accepted as before.

u32 means 0 through 4294967295. Native-size counts use the platform's unsigned integer size.
Existing numeric spellings accepted by each reader, such as leading zeroes, remain valid.
Pressure, prefix-wait and restore-prefetch values retain trimming of spaces and tabs.
Prefix-wait and restore-prefetch still require the first remaining character to be a digit.
CUDA device/segments and the slide test hook retain their space trimming.
Other numeric readers do not gain whitespace aliases. Empty or whitespace-only text means unset for every variable, as it did before.

An explicit `--device` or `--segments` wins over its environment value, even if the ignored value is malformed.
`--carveout` likewise enables the carveout regardless of its enable variable.
The carveout size is checked only when the carveout is enabled, and still rounds to framebuffer rows.
`TF_NO_TREES` retains precedence over `TF_DRAFT_NODES`.
Backend-specific settings are checked when that backend starts; slide settings require learning to be enabled.
Common server settings are checked before checkpoint resolution, including when no request would use them yet.
Direct family readers also refuse malformed values when called without the server.

## Existing lenient switches

These settings retain their existing boolean policies rather than gaining new aliases or refusals:

- `TF_GRAPH_CACHE`: exact `0` or case-insensitive `off` disables graphs; every other value leaves the family's settings unchanged.
- `TF_QWEN27_SLOT_RESUME`: exact `0` disables resume; every other value keeps it enabled.
- Kolibri pages: exact `TENSORFOLD_KOLIBRI_KV_PAGES=0` disables requested pages; other text keeps the option unchanged.
- Dory pages: unset or exact `TENSORFOLD_DORY_KV_PAGES=0` uses windows; every other present value selects pages.
- `TF_SLIDE_EDIT`, `TF_SLIDE_PROBE` and `TF_SLIDE_ROUTED` select modes by presence, even empty or `0`; probe wins over edit.
- `TF_COOP_SPLIT` retains its first-character `0` disabling rule, `TF_NEMOTRON_TRACE` its first-character `1` trace rule,
  and `TF_SLIDE_FIT_REDUCE` its exact `tree` reduction selection. These developer switches keep their existing semantics.
- The existing tool-grammar, rows-sync, log-time, memory-pressure and XPU-MTP boolean policies are unchanged.

The profile registry reports selected arithmetic/experimental overrides; it does not change their parsing or defaults.
See [profiles](profiles.md) for classes, scopes and grouped slide-learning names.
`capabilities --json` no longer advertises `TENSORFOLD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` or `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`: the native binary reads neither.
The command-line `--no-update-check` remains an accepted no-op.
