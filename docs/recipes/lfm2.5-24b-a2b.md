# LFM2.5-24B-A2B, native Metal

This recipe covers [`LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-MLX-4bit`](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-MLX-4bit)
at revision `667408d494bde191c2cb9dd4f4549827816b9275`. The numbers below are measured on this 4-bit export only.

A Mac with less memory may not hold 16 streams at the checkpoint's 131,072-token window; the server then names how
many fit. `--context 40960` holds 16 on a 48 GB M4 Pro.

## Shared rounds

Every stream's tokens go through the lane rounds. A round of several streams is one forward over all their rows.
In it each layer's short conv (30 layers) and each attention layer's qk, attention and merge (10 layers) run once
over every row (`lfm2_segments.metal`), from a table of each stream's cache addresses, row offsets and key counts
(`segments.zig`). Each row's arithmetic is the per-stream kernel's, so a reply equals its solo run. Prompt calls and
one-stream windows keep the per-stream launches. A greedy row takes the GPU's pick of its logits (`lfm2_argmax`);
sampled and masked rows draw on the host. The dense twin takes its MMA window only for matrices of 4,096 outputs or
more (the short conv's input and the head); narrower ones keep the scalar passes.

`zig build test-lfm2` runs the family's tests. `tf-kernel-contract --only lfm2` checks the shared-round kernels and
the pick, and `tf-lfm2-exact` compares windows and shared rounds with one-row decode on the real weights.

## Measured

Greedy, 256 tokens, 16 public prompts, a different one a stream, 3 reps in each of 3 alternated rounds on an M5 Ultra;
aggregate tok/s, the range of the rounds' medians. Before is main at 0d24ecb3 (each stream's own launches), after adds
the shared-round kernels on it. The M4 Pro is not yet measured on a quiet machine.

| Streams | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 258.5-259.2 | 266.5-267.7 |
| 4 | 483.5-486.5 | 565.2-566.1 |
| 8 | 551.5-551.9 | 732.2-735.6 |
| 16 | 660.7-661.9 | 922.5-923.5 |

Every reply was token for token equal before and after, and equal to its solo run and to `"draft": false`.
Cold prefill at 2k, 8k and 32k tokens and peak memory did not change.

## DSpark drafts

LiquidAI's DSpark drafter for this model is
[`LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-DSpark`](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-DSpark/tree/e052e5b1dd103c38cdd4f8ddc068d7dea4586f55)

Without `--drafter` the engine serves as before. `"draft": false` on a request, or `--no-drafts`, turns the drafter
off; the lane core verifies every draft, so a drafted reply equals its `"draft": false` reply token for token.

The drafter has no embedding and no head of its own:

- Context: the target's rows after layers 2, 10, 18, 26 and 34 (the backend's taps, `lfm2_tap`), through `fc` and
  `hidden_norm`, give each of its five layers' context keys and values (k_norm, then RoPE at the row's position).
- Block: the pending token and mask tokens run five Qwen3 layers with non-causal attention over the context and the
  block, then the target's head. A block is as long as the deepest chain its pass holds, at most the nine rows the
  drafter was trained on.
- Markov head: row i's logits plus `W2 W1[previous token]` (rank 256); draft i is their argmax.

The drafter runs the released bf16 matrices as they are (`--drafter-bits 0`, the default). `--drafter-bits 8` instead
quantizes them at load to 8-bit MLX affine codes in groups of 64: about 361 MiB of weights
against 625 MiB. Weight storage does not guarantee serving throughput; the server logs the mode, and 4 bits is refused.
Both run on the family's kernels
(bf16 on `lfm2_bf16_rows`, `lfm2_bf16_mma` and `lfm2_markov_scan_bf16`, 8-bit on `core/tile_qmm`); the q and k rows are reordered so that the target's half-split RoPE kernel gives the
checkpoint's interleaved RoPE. Its own kernels are `lfm2_tap`, `lfm2_attn_block` and `lfm2_attn_block_merge`
(non-causal block attention, the target's attention kernels with a template flag), `lfm2_markov_scan` and
`lfm2_markov_pick` (a Markov step) and `lfm2_draft_ids` (a hold's drafts into the next verify's rows on the GPU, so
the host does not wait for a hold that fits one pass). Each kept prompt state keeps the drafter's context too, so a
drafting stream resumes prompts. Hold lengths follow the lane core's per-round depth pricing; no stream-count guard disables drafting.

Priced shared rounds use the existing lane allocator and the measured block-count/depth grid. Only neural blocks
incur hold cost; copies and forced rows still occupy verify capacity. The native 32-row hold limit can split a
cohort into several passes, priced in execution order rather than as one impossible padded batch.

A new stream waits for its first funded hold while retaining its prompt context. Each lane owns incoming prompt
and verified taps before the target overwrites them, projecting them only for a hold, snapshot or stage overflow.
Zero-grant rounds therefore retain contiguous context for later drafts; they do not disable drafting by stream count.

`tf-kernel-contract --only lfm2` checks these kernels. `tf-lfm2-dspark MODEL DRAFTER TOKENS [ROWS]` runs the drafter
against an fp32 host reference of the released checkpoint (the same taps and the target's embedding and head),
prints each draft against the reference's pick with the margin between the reference's two best tokens, and times
the drafter's passes; a near tie can pick the other token.
