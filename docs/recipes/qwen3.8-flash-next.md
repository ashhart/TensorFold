# Qwen3.8 Flash Next

The `qwen4_exp` family has Gated DeltaNet, sparse attention, MoE, hyper-connections and hashed n-gram
embeddings. The supported checkpoint uses MLX affine 4-bit weights in groups of 32 and includes an MTP head.

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP --name bench
```

On MLX, a supported conversion without the head runs without MTP drafting. On CUDA, pass `--no-drafts`
for such a conversion; the default positive draft depth otherwise refuses the missing head.

## MLX execution

N-gram tables stay in host file mappings when the checkpoint's model files exceed 75% of the GPU's
recommended working set. `TF_NGRAM_HOST=1` forces this mode; `TF_NGRAM_HOST=0` keeps the tables in MLX.
Startup admission uses the same choice as the loader and subtracts the mapped weights, scales and biases
from the checkpoint's size. For the named 4-bit checkpoint, about 29.8 GiB of its 105.4 GiB is mapped,
leaving a conservative 75.6 GiB resident-weight estimate. The default command selects host mode on an
M4 Max with 128 GiB, whose process budget is 89.6 GiB, including the 3 GiB process reserve.

Mapped pages still use RAM while cached. The loader prefetches them after its initial forwards; macOS
can reclaim them, and subsequent lookups may read from disk. The remaining weights must fit the MLX
budget, and the server sizes context from runtime cache and workspace needs. `TENSORFOLD_MEMORY_LIMIT_GB`
can lower the budget; it cannot raise the default ceiling.
After measuring shared rounds, the runtime releases the probes' rollback buffers before sizing prompt
memory, so those unused states do not reduce the available context.

Fused kernels handle hyper-connections, routing, experts, recurrence and sparse attention. Row-exact
projections and stable routing ties keep each verify row independent of the other rows. M5 GPUs use
the lane matmul; M1 through M4 use the per-row projection and hyper-connection kernels by default. Rejected tails
restore recurrent state, n-gram history and attention state, including incomplete pooled blocks.
The load-time row check disables drafting when windows do not reproduce serial steps.

The prefill path uses sparse selected-key attention, fused hyper-connections and n-gram lookups,
stacked DeltaNet projections and sorted expert rows. It submits bounded groups of layers to limit live
workspace. Compatible prefill matmul kernels check against MLX; unsupported paths use MLX's kernels.
`TF_FLASH_PREFILL=0` selects the reference prefill path for comparison.

Prefill and decode can round differently. The chunk planner uses detected assistant-message starts and
the second message when at least 256 tokens follow the previous chunk start, otherwise cutting after
2,048 tokens. Cold and resumed prompts use the same rendered-token boundaries, and reuse starts only
at these cuts. Templates without detected markers use 2,048-token chunks. Snapshots include the prefill
path, resolved matmul route and GPU identity; changing arithmetic requires a fresh cache.

Load-time shared-forward checks compare each stream with its own call. A failed check limits forwards
to one stream, while successful checks allow the lane engine to combine requests.

## CUDA

Use the [container setup](../../RUNBOOK.md#nvidia-gpus). For two ranks, pull the checkpoint on both and
start rank 1 first:

```bash
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.0.2.1
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP --tp 2 --rank 0 --master 192.0.2.1 --name bench --host 0.0.0.0
```

The default CUDA cap is six MTP drafts, with chains stopping below the configured confidence threshold.
`--mtp-drafts N` changes the cap; `--no-drafts` or `"draft": false` selects serial decoding.
Single-request serving uses CUDA graphs for verify windows and draft steps. Two-rank reductions add
gathered partials in rank order.

With one GPU, `--parallel N` enables eager shared forwards for up to N requests; CUDA
`--parallel auto` selects one request. Two ranks serve one request at a time and reject `--parallel N`
when N exceeds one. The single-request engine retains prompt and reply states for prefix reuse; the
concurrent decoder retains prompt snapshots per stream. Cache capacity is allocated at startup; inspect
the reported capacity rather than assuming an older fixed token limit.

N-gram tables are file-backed host data. On unified-memory GPUs they compete with weights and cache
allocations for RAM, so a checkpoint's GPU allocation alone does not describe its memory requirement.

## Draft vocabulary provenance

Both backends read the public list in `src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/draft_vocab.txt`.
It contains 79,591 sorted IDs; MLX pads it with the lowest unused IDs to a multiple of 64 at load.
The target sampler still reads the full vocabulary, so the list affects proposals only.

The corpus is Homebrew CPython 3.14.5's standard-library `*.py` files, excluding `site-packages` and
`__pycache__`. It contains no repository or PyPI package text. Use `tokenizers==0.22.2` and
`tools/draft_vocab.py` with SHA-256
`1baf0dd08669355cf9cf6e32998e5436ce8712c3ab1bffe38d369f3fa3a86b56`.
The tokenizer JSON SHA-256 is:

```text
0997f410c57a1f4e53b09e4be8f4a172d90edd9564368fb0847030937229b9f3
```

Place that tokenizer at `tokenizer.json` and copy the clean stdlib into an empty `cpython` directory,
preserving relative paths. The [Nemotron corpus-copy example](nemotron-3.5.md#draft-vocabulary-provenance)
shows the file-selection rules; change its destination to `cpython`. Then run from the repository root:

```bash
TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false python3 -B tools/draft_vocab.py tokenizer.json draft_vocab.txt --size 79591 --keep-below 65536 --min-count 1 --added-tokens 'cpython/**/*.py'
```

The generator retains all IDs below 65,536 and tokenizer-added IDs, then adds corpus IDs by frequency
and fills remaining places with the lowest unused IDs. It skips empty, unreadable and oversized files.
Expected output SHA-256:

```text
88d5b483a849ae9245b78b69f41f11cdfc8b5c024f0786c1c8196263857cc93e
```

Check this hash before adopting a rebuild; a different stdlib distribution can change the corpus.
The current list replaces the older list whose PyPI corpus was not reproducible.

## Measurements

Use the [public benchmark command](README.md#measurements) with the server above; omit tensor-parallel
flags for one rank. The client supplies fixed public prompts, 64-token replies and seeds 1234 through
1238. Historical rates measured with the earlier draft list do not qualify the current list.

Use a separately pinned public long-context fixture when measuring prefill and reuse. Check fresh versus
resumed prompts across sparse-attention transitions and template changes, as well as drafted versus
serial output. Decode, cold/resumed latency, concurrent throughput and peak memory are
TBD [release-0.3.5].
