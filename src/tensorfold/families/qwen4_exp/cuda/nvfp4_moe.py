"""The NVFP4 MoE (NVIDIA ModelOpt's FP4 format) for the Flash Next CUDA engine.

The Swift 1.5 Flash Next NVFP4 checkpoint quantizes ONLY the routed experts (the 512 experts of the main
layers and of the MTP layer): per expert and projection, packed E2M1 nibbles (uint8 [N, K/2]), fp8e4m3
block scales ([N, K/16]) and a second per-tensor scale. Everything else — the shared expert, the router,
the hyper-connections, DeltaNet, attention, PLE, embeddings, lm_head and the rest of the MTP head — is
stored BF16 (``exclude_modules`` in the checkpoint's quantization config); ``weights.py`` feeds those BF16
tensors here as plain [out, in] tensors.

``MoE4`` is the engine-facing table, on the qmm ``Experts`` face (``count`` / ``width`` / ``dims``): the
routed experts as one stacked FP4 grid per projection — gate and up rows joined row-wise per expert into
an ``[E, 2*NI, K]`` grid so expert ``e`` owns rows ``[e*2NI, (e+1)*2NI)`` (gate rows first, then up) and
down rows into ``[E, D, NI]`` — and the shared expert as an identity-scaled FP4 table
(``nvfp4.fp4_from_bf16``: BF16 values ride the same kernel as scale-1 rows). Expert ids follow the qmm
convention: 0..E-1 routed, E the shared one.

The serving path is the single row-invariant ``nvfp4.matmul``: which rows go to which expert is data, and
a row's bits depend only on its own input, never on the window it was drafted in — the same contract
``tests/cuda/test_flashnext_nvfp4.py`` checks kernel-first, the way ``adding-a-cuda-family.md`` asks.
``gateup_out`` / ``down_out`` take the rows grouped per expert (``groups``: the distinct expert ids in
increasing order, ``perm``: flat row*32 + slot codes per group in expert order, padded with -1 — what
``moe.select`` builds) and write each row back at its own code:

    gate/up: act = silu(bf16(x @ gate.T)) * (x @ up.T)      (the checkpoint's gate and up, one grid)
    down:    y   = act @ down.T                             (fp32 sums: the combine adds the slots in order)

``moe`` is the full step (router, selection, the grouped experts, the shared expert with its sigmoid
gate) into the qmm ``MoEBuffers`` contract: ``y`` [R, slots, D] fp32 with slot k the shared expert,
``wts`` the routed weights then the shared gate. The grouped loop is one ``nvfp4.matmul`` per distinct
expert — the same per-row arithmetic as the one-expert path; the flat batched kernel joins when it
measures faster on Spark.
